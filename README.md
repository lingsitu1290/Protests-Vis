Spark
--------

**Description**

Inspired by the attempted Turkish coup on July 15th 2016, Spark was created to visualize and analyze 2016 protests around the world over time. An application programming interface is also created for ease of access to data for developers.

**How it works**

Users can click on the slider in the map view to scroll through dates, which changes the map to display that day's protests. The size of markers depends on the number of events for that particular latitude and longitude. Markers are also clickable for the first URL associated with the event. In addition, users can select a month and day to display various charts for protests analysis.
